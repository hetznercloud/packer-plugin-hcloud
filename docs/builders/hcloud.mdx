# Hetzner Cloud Builder

Type: `hcloud`
Artifact BuilderId: `hcloud.builder`

The `hcloud` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with [Hetzner
Cloud](https://www.hetzner.cloud). The builder takes a source image, runs any
provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots it into
a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the foundation of new
servers that are launched within the Hetzner Cloud.

The builder does _not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

The builder will connect to the server using the first available IP, in the following order:

- `public_ipv4`
- `public_ipv6`
- `private_ipv4`

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required Builder Configuration options:

- `token` (string) - The client TOKEN to use to access your account. It can
  also be specified via environment variable `HCLOUD_TOKEN`, if set.

- `image` (string) - ID or name of image to launch server from. Alternatively
  you can use `image_filter`.

- `location` (string) - The name of the location to launch the server in.

- `server_type` (string) - ID or name of the server type this server should
  be created with.

### Optional:

- `endpoint` (string) - Non standard api endpoint URL. Set this if you are
  using a Hetzner Cloud API compatible service. It can also be specified via
  environment variable `HCLOUD_ENDPOINT`.

- `image_filter` (object) - Filters used to populate the `filter`
  field. Example:

  ```hcl
  image_filter {
    most_recent   = true
    with_selector = ["name==my-image"]
  }
  ```

  This selects the most recent image with the label `name==my-image`. NOTE:
  This will fail unless _exactly_ one AMI is returned. In the above example,
  `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.

  - `with_selector` (list of strings) - label selectors used to select an
    `image`. NOTE: This will fail unless _exactly_ one image is returned.
    Check the official hcloud docs on
    [Label Selectors](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview-label-selector)
    for more info.

  - `most_recent` (boolean) - Selects the newest created image when true.
    This is most useful if you base your image on another Packer build image.

  You may set this in place of `image`, but not both.

- `server_name` (string) - The name assigned to the server. The Hetzner Cloud
  sets the hostname of the machine to this value.

- `server_labels` (map of key/value strings) - Key/value pair labels to
  apply to the created server.

- `snapshot_name` (string) - The name of the resulting snapshot that will
  appear in your account as image description. Defaults to `packer-{{timestamp}}` (see
  [configuration templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) for more info).
  The snapshot_name must be unique per architecture.
  If you want to reference the image as a sample in your terraform configuration please use the image id or the `snapshot_labels`.

- `snapshot_labels` (map of key/value strings) - Key/value pair labels to
  apply to the created image.

- `poll_interval` (string) - Configures the interval in which actions are
  polled by the client. Default `500ms`. Increase this interval if you run
  into rate limiting errors.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the server. Packer will not
  automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting down the
  instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the server.

- `ssh_keys_labels` (map of key/value strings) - Key/value pair labels to
  apply to the created ssh keys.

- `ssh_keys` (array of strings) - List of SSH keys by name or id to be added
  to image on launch.

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSHTemporaryKeyPair-not-required.mdx'

- `rescue` (string) - Enable and boot in to the specified rescue system. This
  enables simple installation of custom operating systems. `linux64` or `linux32`

- `upgrade_server_type` (string) - ID or name of the server type this server should
  be upgraded to, without changing the disk size. Improves building performance.
  The resulting snapshot is compatible with smaller server types and disk sizes.

- `networks` (array of integers) - List of Network IDs which should be
  attached to the server private network interface at creation time.

- `public_ipv4` (string) - ID, name or IP address of a pre-allocated Hetzner
  Primary IPv4 address to use for the created server.

- `public_ipv4_disabled` (bool) - Disable the public ipv4 for the created server.

- `public_ipv6` (string) - ID, name or IP address of a pre-allocated Hetzner
  Primary IPv6 address to use for the created server.

- `public_ipv4_disabled` (bool) - Disable the public ipv6 for the created server.

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid as soon as you enter your own
access tokens:

```hcl
source "hcloud" "basic_example" {
  token = "YOUR API TOKEN"
  image = "ubuntu-22.04"
  location = "nbg1"
  server_type = "cx22"
  ssh_username = "root"
}

build {
  sources  = ["source.hcloud.basic_example"]
}
```
