# Hetzner Cloud Builder

Type: `hcloud`
Artifact BuilderId: `hcloud.builder`

The `hcloud` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with [Hetzner
Cloud](https://www.hetzner.cloud). The builder takes a source image, runs any
provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots it into
a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the foundation of new
servers that are launched within the Hetzner Cloud.

The builder does _not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required Builder Configuration options:

@include 'builder/hcloud/Config-required.mdx'

### Optional:

@include 'builder/hcloud/Config-not-required.mdx'

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid as soon as you enter your own
access tokens:

```hcl
source "hcloud" "basic_example" {
  token = "YOUR API TOKEN"
  image = "ubuntu-22.04"
  location = "nbg1"
  server_type = "cx11"
  ssh_username = "root"
}

build {
  sources  = ["source.hcloud.basic_example"]
}
```
