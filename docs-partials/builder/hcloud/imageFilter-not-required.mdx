- `with_selector` ([]string) - Label selectors used to select an `image`. See the [Label Selectors
  docs](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#label-selector) for more info.
  
  NOTE: This will fail unless _exactly_ one image is returned.

- `most_recent` (bool) - Selects the newest created image when true. This is useful if you base your image
  on another Packer build image.
