- `endpoint` (string) - Configures the client endpoint. It can also be specified with the
  `HCLOUD_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

- `poll_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Configures the interval at which the API is polled by the client. Default
  `500ms`. Increase this interval if you run into rate limiting errors.

- `server_name` (string) - Name assigned to the server. Hetzner Cloud sets the hostname of the server to
  this value.

- `upgrade_server_type` (string) - ID or name of the server type the server should be upgraded to, without changing
  the disk size. This improves building performance and the resulting snapshot is
  compatible with smaller server types and disk sizes.

- `image_filter` (\*imageFilter) - Filters used to populate the `image` field. You may set this in place of `image`,
  but not both.
  
  This selects the most recent image with the label `name==my-image`:
  
  ```hcl
  image_filter {
    most_recent   = true
    with_selector = ["name==my-image"]
  }
  ```
  
  NOTE: This will fail unless _exactly_ one image is returned. In the above
  example, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.
  
  @include 'builder/hcloud/imageFilter-not-required.mdx'

- `snapshot_name` (string) - Name of the resulting snapshot that will appear in your project as image
  description. Defaults to `packer-{{timestamp}}` (see [configuration
  templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) for more info).
  The `snapshot_name` must be unique per architecture. If you want to reference the
  image as a sample in your terraform configuration please use the image id or the
  `snapshot_labels`.

- `snapshot_labels` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair labels to apply to the created image.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch the server with. Packer will not automatically wait for a
  user script to finish before shutting down the instance this must be handled in a
  provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user data when launching the server. See
  the `user_data` field.

- `ssh_keys` ([]string) - List of SSH keys names or IDs to be added to image on launch.
  
  @include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSHTemporaryKeyPair-not-required.mdx'

- `networks` ([]int64) - List of Network IDs to attach to the server private network interface at creation
  time.

- `rescue` (string) - Enable and boot in to the specified rescue system. This enables simple
  installation of custom operating systems. `linux64` or `linux32`
